                    Do you find yourself wondering how far your favorite area of mathematics is still away from being formalized, and what lies ahead?
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                  The Lean for the Curious Mathematician colloquium will showcase recent formalization and teaching projects with Lean.  
                It will give an impression of the current developments in computer-assisted theorem proving
                  and invite to reflect on its future role in mathematics.

                    <p class="title">Lean into Learning: Bridging Educational Gaps and Assessing Progress in Mathematics</p>
                    <p class="abstract">This presentation delves into the
                    transformative role of Lean in smoothing the transition from
                    school to university mathematics, while exploring its
                    promising but complex potential in summative assessment.
                    Based on first-hand experiences from teaching a large cohort
                    of first-year undergraduates and outreach work in schools,
                    we'll discuss how Lean demystifies intricate concepts and
                    fosters active student engagement. Additionally, we'll
                    critically examine the use of Lean for summative assessments
                    in a large-scale undergraduate course, identifying not only
                    its distinct advantages but also grappling with its inherent
                    challenges. This talk aims to provide a comprehensive,
                    balanced view of Lean's impact and its potential to
                    revolutionise mathematics education and assessment.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">In this talk, I will discuss the distinguishing features
                    of the various proof assistants. I will start with
                    a short introduction to the history of interactive
                    theorem proving. I will continue with the discussion
                    of proof assistant foundations, set theory and HOL.
                    Next I will discuss the strengths of the various approaches,
                    including proof languages, automation, and formal
                      proof readability.</p>

                      <p class="title">The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis in Lean</p>
                      <p class="abstract">In 2019 I formalized the independence of the continuum hypothesis in Lean together with Jesse Han.
                        The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinality between the cardinalities of ℕ and ℝ,
                        and was famously proven independent of ZFC by Paul Cohen in 1963.
                        We used Boolean-valued models to give forcing arguments for both the consistency of CH and the unprovability of CH.
                        Boolean-valued models are models where relations (like membership) take values in a chosen Boolean algebra.</p>
                      <p class="abstract">In this talk I will look back at the project and explain the proof and the design decisions we used in the project.
                        Due to the work of Aaron Anderson the basic model theory used in the project was improved and incorporated in mathlib,
                        and I will also discuss this.</p>
