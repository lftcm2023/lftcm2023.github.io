                    <p class="title">Lean into Learning: Bridging Educational Gaps and Assessing Progress in Mathematics</p>
                    <p class="abstract">This presentation delves into the
                      transformative role of Lean in smoothing the transition from
                      school to university mathematics, while exploring its
                      promising but complex potential in summative assessment.
                      Based on first-hand experiences from teaching a large cohort
                      of first-year undergraduates and outreach work in schools,
                      we'll discuss how Lean demystifies intricate concepts and
                      fosters active student engagement. Additionally, we'll
                      critically examine the use of Lean for summative assessments
                      in a large-scale undergraduate course, identifying not only
                      its distinct advantages but also grappling with its inherent
                      challenges. This talk aims to provide a comprehensive,
                      balanced view of Lean's impact and its potential to
                      revolutionise mathematics education and assessment.</p>

                      <p class="title">Probability in the Lean mathematical library</p>
                      <p class="abstract">The Lean mathematical library, mathlib, is a growing
                      collection of mathematical results from algebra, analysis,
                      topology, measure theory, etc., put together in the same
                      formal library in a way that makes them compatible with
                      each other. Building on all those fields, we recently
                      started the development of probability theory. I will
                      present an overview of the current probability results in
                      mathlib and focus in particular on work done in
                      collaboration with Kexing Ying on stochastic processes,
                      martingales and Doob's convergence theorems. I will also
                      discuss future progress and identify important results
                        which could now be formalized by interested contributors.</p>

                    <p class="abstract">In this talk, I will discuss the distinguishing features
                    of the various proof assistants. I will start with
                    a short introduction to the history of interactive
                    theorem proving. I will continue with the discussion
                    of proof assistant foundations, set theory and HOL.
                    Next I will discuss the strengths of the various approaches,
                    including proof languages, automation, and formal
                      proof readability.</p>

                      <p class="title">The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis in Lean</p>
                      <p class="abstract">In 2019 I formalized the independence of the continuum hypothesis in Lean together with Jesse Han.
                        The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinality between the cardinalities of ℕ and ℝ,
                        and was famously proven independent of ZFC by Paul Cohen in 1963.
                        We used Boolean-valued models to give forcing arguments for both the consistency of CH and the unprovability of CH.
                        Boolean-valued models are models where relations (like membership) take values in a chosen Boolean algebra.</p>
                      <p class="abstract">In this talk I will look back at the project and explain the proof and the design decisions we used in the project.
                        Due to the work of Aaron Anderson the basic model theory used in the project was improved and incorporated in mathlib,
                        and I will also discuss this.</p>

                      <p class="title">On a formalization of Gromov's h-principle and Smale's sphere eversion theorem in Lean</p>
                      <p class="abstract">Since different branches of
                      mathematics present different challenges to the formal
                      mathematician, it is important to formalise as varied a
                      collection of results as possible. The challenges
                      presented by algebra or combinatorics certainly differ
                      from those presented by differential topology, where an
                      informal proof might just be a picture. Massot thus
                      proposed the challenge to formalise a deep result in
                      differential topology (Gromov's h-principle for
                      first-order open, ample differential relations) together
                      with a famous counter-intuitive corollary: Smale's sphere
                      eversion theorem. We will discuss the successful
                      completion of this challenge by van Doorn, Massot, and the
                      speaker. No knowledge of differential topology will be
                      assumed, and the emphasis will be on general lessons for
                        today's formal mathematicians.</p>

                      <p class="title">Theorem Proving via Machine Learning</p>
                      <p class="abstract">
                        Machine learning, especially large language models
                        (LLMs), has shown promise in mathematical reasoning.
                        This talk provides a comprehensive introduction to
                        leveraging machine learning for theorem proving in proof
                        assistants, such as by automatically suggesting useful
                        tactics or premises. After a broad overview of existing
                        work in this domain, I will focus on LeanDojo: an
                        open-source suite of tools, datasets, and models for
                        developing LLM-based theorem provers. Finally, I will
                        discuss ongoing projects and future steps for
                        integrating machine learning tools into the workflow of
                        Lean users.
